    <h2>My <em class="dance">Dance</em> Background</h2>
    <p>
      I have been <em class="dance">dancing</em> since she was 5 years old. I
      started at a small <em class="dance">dance</em> studio in Lower Manhattan
      called the Lower East Side Dance Academy. Here, I learned
      <strong class="style">Ballet</strong>,
      <strong class="style">Jazz</strong>, and
      <strong class="style">Tap</strong>, and later on joined the studios
      competition team.

    <p>
      I left my elementary school in 3rd grade to attend Ballet Tech, a NYC
      public school for <em class="dance">dance</em>, which is like LaGuardia,
      only much smaller and solely for dance. I continued to train in
      <strong class="style">Classical Ballet</strong> and learned the repertory
      of the school's founder, Eliot Feld, to perform in an end-of-year
      performance called "Kids Dance", which was performed at the Joyce Theater
      in Manhattan, New York.

    <h2>Present Day</h2>
    <p>
      I have been <em class="dance">dancing</em> at LaGuardia High School since
      my freshman year.

    <p>
      At LaGuardia, I have been exposed to the Modern Techniques of
      <strong class="style">Graham</strong>,
      <strong class="style">Limon</strong>, and
      <strong class="style">Horton</strong>, and Contemporary dance. I have
      continued taking classes in <strong class="style">Ballet</strong>,
      <strong class="style">Tap</strong>, and
      <strong class="style">Jazz</strong>. In my Junior Year, I was able to
      choreograph a piece alongside 4 other dance majors to perform at a
      showcase in the Little Flower Theater.
